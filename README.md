# NE-Mediterranean-Thermal-Conditions

It is a dashboard displaying the subsurface thermal conditions in the NE Mediterranean region. This is my first project that I have used PostgreSQL for database connection.

The application is consisted of 3 tabs. Overview tab provides statistical information while 2D plots section allows users to interact with cross-plots demonstrating thermal conditions for all wells or a selected well. It also compares the results of 3 different BHT conversion methods known as; Horner-plot method, AAPG correction and Harrison et al. (1983).

The last tab, Map View, illustrates the temperature, geothermal gradient, and heat flow maps for every 500 meters between 500m to 4.5km depth. The maps reveal the effects of the regional tectonics and how it controls the subsurface thermal behaviour along the Cilicia and Latakia Basins.

All maps and cross-plots are interactive, and their styles can be changed according to the userâ€™s preferences. They can also be downloaded as images for possible use in scientific publishment and/or presentations.
